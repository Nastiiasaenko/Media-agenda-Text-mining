## 📝 Introduction  
The media plays a **crucial role** in shaping political narratives by determining **which topics are covered** and **which are ignored**. This thesis explores **agenda-setting strategies** in Russian and U.S. media between **2014–2020**, particularly in **foreign policy** and **domestic political coverage**.

### **Key Research Question**
➡️ What are the specific **agenda-setting strategies** used in the U.S. and Russia?

### **Key Concepts**
- **Agenda-Setting Theory** ([[Agenda-Setting Theory]])
- **Framing & Issue Salience** ([[Frame Analysis]])
- **Bias & Censorship** in Media
- **Noisiness Strategy** (Russia) vs. **Framing Strategy** (USA)

## 📖 Theoretical Framework  
### **1. Agenda-Setting Theory** ([[Agenda-Setting Theory]])
- Media does **not** tell people **what to think** but rather **what to think about**.
- Concept of **Issue Salience**: The importance assigned to an issue based on frequency & prominence.  
- **McCombs & Shaw (1972)**: Media shapes public discourse by focusing on selected issues.

### **2. Framing Theory** ([[Frame Analysis]])
- **How** issues are covered matters: media frames shape public perception.
- Example: U.S. media frames **Trump-Russia** ties differently than **Obama-Russia** relations.

### **3. Media Systems Theory**
- **Hallin & Mancini (2014)**: Media systems differ by country:
  - 🏛 **U.S. = Liberal Model** (market-driven, competitive, partisan)
  - 🏢 **Russia = Statist-Commercial Model** (state-controlled with private influence)

---

## 🎯 Hypotheses  
1. **Bias Exists in Both Countries**  
   - Foreign policy coverage is **skewed**, often **silencing** certain topics.  
2. **Post-2014 Tensions Recreated a Cold War Narrative**  
   - U.S. & Russia **amplify antagonistic coverage**.
3. **Russia Uses "Noisiness" Strategy**  
   - Overloads media with foreign policy to **distract** from internal issues.
4. **U.S. Media Aligns with Partisan Interests**  
   - Political coverage **favors party priorities**.

### **🛠 Analysis Techniques**
